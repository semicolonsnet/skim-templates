# skim-templates
Templates for exporting notes in [Skim](https://skim-app.sourceforge.io), a PDF annotation app for macOS. Have a look at [this script](https://gist.github.com/semicolonsnet/ccfad9f197a262690c0fc7fb12876e20) if you want to automate the process of exporting notes.

Add these files to ~/Library/Application Support/Skim/Templates, and create the folder if it does not already exist.
